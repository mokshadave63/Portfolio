        description: 'Developed a data-driven credit evaluation tool to assess farmers’ creditworthiness based on past loans, land area, yearly income, and crop capacity. Factors are normalized, weighted, and combined to generate a 0-100 eligibility score. The frontend collects farmer data, while the backend (Node.js + Python) processes it. The final eligibility score is stored and can be accessed by banks for decision-making. Integrated GIS data, weather forecasts, soil health metrics, and crop yields to enhance credit assessment accuracy.',
